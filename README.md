ReadMe
======

A Spritz like library for iOS. (WIP)

### Simple usage
To use it, simply drag and drop the two classes in your Xcode project.
Then, to launch the reading process with the ReadMeLabel just call `readText:` on the label instance. The default reading speed is 300 words per minute. To stop the reading process, simply call `stopReading`. There is no need to call the stop method, the process will stop when it reaches the end of the text.

```
  [myLabel readText:@"This is an amazing text to read."];
  ...
  [myLabel stopReading]; //Optional
```

### Custom control
You can create your custom control by implementing the delegate methods. Feel free to show them to the world !

---

#### ReadMeDelegate Protocol Reference
You can implements these delegate methods to handle your own ReadMe control if you do not want to use ReadMeLabel.
